# TypeScript Server Side Anatomy

I've created this repo to explain **what TypeScript server(tsserver) does under your editors**.

- How editor/IDEs communicate with tsserver
- File structure(Script Version Cache) in language service host
- How TS's incremental parser works
- etc...

This repository, created for tsjp meetup #1, includes the following:

- Presentation slides
- Web editor application using TS language service
- Test script to measure TS's incremental parser performance
